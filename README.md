# MLS Library

mls_lib is a Python library containing a set of classes, organized in different packages, representing the structure and the main concepts required to instantiate and orchestrate any ML pipeline, its stages and the tasks that these stages perform. These classes have been carefully designed to meet Software Engineering design principles. 

The code of specific ML pipelines, generated by the [mls_code_generator](https://github.com/MLSToolbox/mls_code_generator) component, imports the mls_lib and instantiates the classes for these pipelines, ensuring the high quality of the generated code. The library code documentation may be found at the following [link](https://mlstoolbox.github.io/mls_lib/).

## Documentation

Details on the packages and classes included are available on [this repository Wiki](https://github.com/MLSToolbox/mls_lib/wiki).
